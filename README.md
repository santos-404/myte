# Myte - Programming language

Welcome to **Myte**, a new programming language currently in active development.

This is an early-stage project, and **Myte is not yet fully implemented or usable**. Many features are still being designed or built, and the syntax and behavior may change frequently.

If you're curious about the goals and design of Myte, check out the [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md) file, where you'll find more in-depth information on the project.
