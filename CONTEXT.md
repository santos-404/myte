# Myte programming language â€” Project context

Welcome to the internal documentation and development context for the **Myte** programming language. This file contains essential information on what Myte is, what technologies and processes are involved, and how development is organized.

> ðŸš§ Myte is under heavy construction. Nothing is guaranteed to work, and many components are placeholders.

## 1. General information

- **Project Name**: Myte
- **Status**: Pre-alpha / Experimental
- **Purpose**: To explore compiler construction, language design, and create a modern language from scratch.
- **Language type**: Interpreted progamming language. It follows an imperative and procedural paradigm.
- **Main Repository**: [github.com/santos-404/myte](https://github.com/santos-404/myte)

---

## 2. Project goals

The primary goals of Myte are:

- Learn and apply language design principles.
- Build a working interpreter from scratch.
- Explore typing systems, parsing techniques, and runtime design.
- Create something usable, expressive, and maybe fun!

> Note: This is both an educational and experimental project.

## 3. Technologies and tools

Currently used (or planned) technologies:

- **Language**: Go, using only the Go standard library â€” no third-party dependencies.
- **Lexer and parser**: Hand-written recursive descent parser and a custom lexer.
- **AST Construction**: Manually built abstract syntax tree (AST) structures.
- **Evaluation**: Tree-walk interpreter pattern.
- **Testing**: Basic test suite.
- **Docs**: Markdown-based internal documentation for now.

## 4. Building and running

> These instructions will evolve once the language has a buildable structure.
